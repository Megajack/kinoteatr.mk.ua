A very simple module which would allow you to show all/any comments attached to all node translations. Just a great way to communicate in truly multi-lingual environments.

For example I have node in English and Spanish. Drupal natural way would be to show comments for en/es translation separately (attached to en/es content).  But i18n_comments will aggregate all English and Spanish comments for any translations. It doesn't matter if user will leave a comment to any node translation.

Probably not perfect yet, please test it and submit any bugs. 

How to use it: just enable the module.

Need your help: not yet tested with Drupal forums.
